All corrections and suggestions are welcome. I hope it will be useful to the community. Greetings.

To integrate a new event this plugin manually:

It is only necessary to call the function add_new_notification() with appropriate parameters, this would be called into elgg action where running the desired event.

	add_new_notification($to_user_guid, $from_user_guid, $action_type, $entity_guid, $description);
